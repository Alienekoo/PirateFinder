# PirateFinder

` PIRATE FINDER `

## Overview
PirateFinder is a Joy (https://github.com/cisco/joy/blob/master/README.md) based software package for extracting data features from live network traffic or packet capture files (pcap) files, using a flow-oriented model similar to that of IPFIX or NetFlow, and then using these data features with analysis tools to detect and identify pirated video flows.

The classifiers for detecting video piracy are sample classifiers. 

PirateFinder is alpha/beta software and is not suitable for production use.
